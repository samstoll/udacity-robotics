Scripts (in Project5/catkin_ws/src/scripts):
- test_slam.sh: run SLAM to create a map of the environment
- test_navigation.sh: Use AMCL to localize within the map created by SLAM
- home_service.sh: Adds a marker at the pickup zone, the robot navigates there, the pickup marker is hidden and the robot waits 5 seconds to simulate a pickup. Then the robot navigates to the dropoff location and the marker appears there when it arrives.

Usage notes:
To use the SLAM-generated map, the map_file parameter to the amcl launch file in each relevant script must be updated to reflect the location of the map. A SLAM generated map is located in the Project5/cakin_ws/src/map/ sub-directory.
